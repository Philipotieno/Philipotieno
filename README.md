# 👋 Hi, I'm [Mitch (Philip Otieno)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipotieno/)

I build software that solves problems people don’t even realize they have — yet.

I’m passionate about crafting powerful backend systems, automating workflows, and integrating cloud technologies to deliver reliable and scalable solutions. With 5+ years of experience, I bridge the gap between raw ideas and fully functional systems that impact lives and organizations.
